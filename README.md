# Bank Loan Report – Excel Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive Excel dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key aspects of a bank’s loan portfolio. The dashboard transforms raw lending data into actionable business insights through powerful visualizations and dynamic filtering.

## Overview

The dashboard allows users to instantly review core metrics such as total loan applications, funded and received amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. By segmenting “Good” and “Bad” loans, the report supports risk management and quality assessment for stakeholders.

Interactive overview pages highlight trends across time periods, geography (by state), loan purposes, employment lengths, and home ownership status. The detailed data sheet ensures transparency and enables further breakdowns.
